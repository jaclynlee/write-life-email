Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #83 | november 23, 2022
========================================================

[Note: this letter contains a boatload of embedded links. I would normally include them all in the plain text version, but I ran out of time today due to a technical issue cropping up and taking 90 minutes I did not have on a Wednesday! Rather than punt any more work to the day after Thanksgiving, I'm sending it out like this and encouraging you to check the html version when you get a chance: https://newsletters.jaclynpaul.com/writelife_archive/2022/2022-11-083.html]

November always feels like a transitional month for me -- trees losing their leaves, setting the clocks back, putting flannel sheets on the bed and turning on the heat -- but this year it feels doubly so. I'm writing on some new projects, but also preparing for an epically extroverted time as I approach my spring book launch.

Catching up with friends the other day, I summed 2022 up as a year when I "did a ton of work I couldn't share, but will be able to take a lot of public pride in...soon." This is the author lifestyle -- at least when things go right.

Before I can do the public-facing celebration part, I need to lay the groundwork. Most authors do a lot of publicity leg work these days, no matter the size of their publisher.

Wondering what that looks like for me, for this book, six months pre-launch? Here's a sampling of my November:

 * I had to get all my blurbs to the publisher by Thanksgiving. Blurbs are snippets of praise from reviewers, celebrities, and/or other authors. (You can see mine for She's Not Home in the book's press kit.) Blurb quotes are printed on your book cover and, if you get enough of them, in an "advance praise" section in the front of the book. Good blurbs from sources your readers trust help sell books! Authors must reach out to people and ask them to read our book and send us a blurb. Terrifying. This month I followed up with anyone who hadn't gotten a blurb back to me yet and sent the last ones over to the publisher.

 * In art school they taught us to keep a detailed record of everything you do: awards, bylines, shows, grants, all the things. This is such good advice for any profession that requires a portfolio. This month I'm reviewing lists of podcasts and radio shows I've appeared on in the past and preparing to pitch those folks with information about my new book.

 * I finally got a media kit up on my website. This will save me a whole bunch of time. I love having my bios, headshots, and latest book information all in one place because I will no longer have to gather and email these materials individually every time someone requests them.

 * I traveled to my hometown to take some seasonally-appropriate pictures of setting inspirations for She's Not Home and visit a couple local bookstores. I like to make these connections in person with a copy of the book in hand whenever I can. This felt especially important given the local connection. I would love to have an author event near my hometown (and the place that inspired the book)!

 * Galleys/advance review copies of She's Not Home will go out in force in January. Some of you have already signed up for my street team email list -- thank you! I'm actively building the list this month. These folks will receive those early copies of the book to read, review on Goodreads, pick for their book club, recommend to friends, etc. I'm also making a list of reviewers who will receive a goody bag with a physical galley. Publishers can recommend people for these lists, but it's the author who needs to make the one-on-one connection.

 * Even though things feel super busy, I feel like I can't slow down on my posts to my blog and social media. I find it super off-putting when authors only become active online when they have something to promote. It feels tacky. A good literary citizen uses their public presence to build up other authors and support their community, giving at least as much as they take. To that end, I'm really stoked to participate in a cover reveal for a fellow author on Instagram this coming Monday. I like them and their work a whole lot and it feels like a privilege to help spread the good word.

 * Lastly, I'm keeping my ear out for other local creators with work coming out next year. My launch event will be a reading and discussion "in conversation with" another public figure to be announced at a later date. The bookstore will want to reach out to people who might be a good fit for this early next year. While they don't require my input in that process, it behooves me to be involved and try to ensure my conversation partner is someone who will set all of us up for success.
I'm sure I missed something! It's been a busy month. And between all of this, I'm trying to get some decent words in on a couple new projects.

I hope you're having a lovely Thanksgiving week and this message provides a respite from all the retail emails flooding our inboxes. Until next time!

xoxo,

Jaclyn
