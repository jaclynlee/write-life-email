Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #68 | february 10, 2022
========================================================

Hey pals! Sorry for the long silence. I got lost in the weeds during December and January, then I apparently wrote but never sent the installment of this newsletter intended for January 25? What an adventure. Things are on a much more even keel now, and it feels good to type a few words to you about life's plot lines.

I spent last week on our family's annual ski trip to northern Vermont. Exactly what I needed after a month of epic editing work. Every time I travel north, I feel so at home I wonder why I don't live there.

Then I invariably spend part of the five-hundred-mile drive home scrolling real estate listings and imagining the logistics of actually making this happen. What would stop me from living on the grounds of a ski resort full-time? Or buying a ramshackle farmhouse with enough land for a chicken coop and sprawling vegetable gardens? Or, if I didn't want to give up city life entirely, a house in Burlington with a view of Lake Champlain?

Some would say, hey, you love the place, just do it! And yes, I have the freedom and the work ethic to be living in Vermont by this time next year. But my storyline hasn't taken me there. At least not yet.

As a writer, I seek paths to get my characters where I want them to end up. I write and I rewrite. Though a story may never feel truly done, I arrive at something can make peace with. An imperfect journey, but one that nonetheless feels satisfying and right. The feeling is similar to tuning an instrument, smoothing the roughness into something strong and true.

My stories often end differently than I thought they would when I began. Their strong, true note settles on a different tone than I expected.

I see real life much the same way. It's easy to look back and ask, "why didn't I take that opportunity?" or to pine for a different situation than the one I'm in. In a way, that's the point. I'm probably at the middle of my story, a place where the plot fills with turning points.

Yet we can only take one path at each fork. Last month I turned in my final copy of a manuscript I've held onto for years. In all that time, I've lived more with the story's characters than I could ever put on the page. Each book can only tell one story.

In real life, too, we can only move forward in time. Every plot line has paths not taken. Inflection points whose impact only feels inevitable in hindsight. We need these, otherwise the story will feel "too easy." It will lack the tension to keep our interest.

Those paths not taken can feel like opportunities lost. I'd rather see them as driving forces behind the story we end up putting on the page. They keep us moving, keep us thinking, remind us to stop and listen to our gut and consider what might bring our story into balance. Without them, we wouldn't have much of a story at all.

Right now my story has me here in Baltimore. My love for this place is only enriched by my love for other places, and the serendipity of my landing here instead of there. But like any good story, only time will tell where the last page finds me.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
