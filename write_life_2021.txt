The past week has been a flurry of activity. I have a lot on my mind. And yet my brain continues to surface the oddest things.

Did anyone else notice I neglected to list reading and writing in my roundup at the bottom of this email? What the heck? I think this came to me as I was falling asleep one night.

Also, which passages should I read from She's Not Home at the launch event? Is this the kind of thing about which I should ask someone for advice, or do people expect me to figure it out myself?

Why are we still doing Daylight Savings Time?

These swirling thoughts are nothing new. I always get anxious before a big event or deadline. In part, it's an ADHD thing. I get nervous I'll lose track of something important.

This time around, I feel like I'm actually getting a grip on my thoughts and my nerves, which begs another question: what if I'm not feeling nervous enough? What if I'm worrying in the wrong direction?

To which I say, it'll all work out in the end.

Recently I was struggling with a problem at the bouldering gym. I got halfway through it and could not see a path to the finish. Finally I realized I needed to reach my leg way back to get my toe onto a tricky foothold. It was a bit of a leap of faith. Would my short little leg reach? Or would I slip and fall in a heap onto the mat ten feet below? It was a scary reach. I couldn't fully see my footing. And yet when I went for it, everything came together.

I've begun taking more of these small leaps of faith at the gym. I've gotten stronger. Practiced more. Built trust in myself.

This trust and sturdiness is part hard work, part having buddies who push me to do my best and tell me, "You can do it."
I think that's been grounding me as I prepare for this book launch, too. Not only have I worked ridiculously hard on this book, I have a whole team behind me. I trust them. As I prepare to do the writerly equivalent of that scary reach at the rock gym, I trust everything will come together. I just have to go for it.

Thank you all for coming on this wild ride with me. I can't wait to hear what you think of She's Not Home. If you're near Baltimore, I'd also love to see you at the launch event the evening of April 25. Don't be shy ‚Äî or, if you are feeling shy, just bring a friend!

xoxo,

Lena
