Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #81 | october 14, 2022
========================================================

In my last letter I wrote about the length of a day. However, these days we can also benefit from noticing shorter lengths of time. Sometimes a tiny slice of time is all we have to devote to a new hobby, or cleaning the house, or writing a book.

Readers familiar with my work on the ADHD Homestead might know I love mini habits (https://adhdhomestead.net/tag/mini-habits/). I first learned about mini habits through a book of the same name by Stephen Guise (https://adhdhomestead.net/mini-habits/). Guise's central conceit, which completely changed the way I approach habits, is we should set goals to be achievable rather than ambitious (https://adhdhomestead.net/try-smaller/). If you're not a little bit embarrassed by your daily goal – for example, I once set a goal to open the word document for a book project, not even write any words -- the goal might be too high.

A daily habit needs to feel accessible -- even on a tired, off day when we feel we have nothing to throw at it.

Because I am a Hard Worker(tm) and struggle mightily to make time for myself, I have a mini habit goal to engage with a hobby every day. I have no expectations for how much or what I do. On a daily basis, I simply want to touch some aspect of an activity that is just for me. Something with no material value to other people or my professional work.

The other day I was hemming and hawing over whether I should go to the bouldering gym. Did I have time? Did I even want to climb that day, or was I pressuring myself to fulfill my "hobby" checkbox for achievement more than pleasure? What if I would actually be happier working instead, to reduce stress over my overflowing inbox?

"Just touch something," I reminded myself. Sometimes we have busy days. Time and focus feel scant.

Then I thought, why not work on the shelves I'm building for the basement? The boards were already out on sawhorses. The shop vac and sander were already out, too.

I set a timer for twenty-five minutes, turned on a podcast, and got to sanding. I made so much progress, I at one point worried I'd set my timer incorrectly and missed school pickup. But I hadn't.

Twenty-five minutes was just a surprisingly long time.

I tell this story because I hear a lot of people ask, "How do you make time to write an entire book?" Writer friends who freelance full-time lament, "I don't have any time to write for myself." I've finished manuscripts all sorts of ways, and I truly believe it's better to capture twenty-five minutes and use it wisely than to fixate on finding several contiguous hours. If I come into it prepared, I can write a startling number of words in twenty-five minutes. Add up twenty-five minutes here, forty there, and we start to get somewhere.

Twenty-five minutes is an amount of time we can use without thinking. It can pass unnoticed while we scroll through our phones. My experience sanding my shelves for twenty-five minutes this week reminded me to use time intentionally. To recognize its value, and never avoid something I want to do because there "isn't much time."

Something is better than nothing here.

Yes, writing a book takes a really long time. Hundreds of hours. So do a lot of things. But unless you're under contract, working on a deadline, there aren't many hard-and-fast rules for how you divvy up that time. Every day we do nothing because we have too little time and energy to "make it worth it" is another day before we get to feel that rush of pleasure at our progress.

For me, it's also one more day I have to contort myself around a stack of wood to access my washing machine. I'll take the twenty-five minutes, thank you very much.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
