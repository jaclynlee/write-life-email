Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #82 | october 28, 2022
========================================================

Earlier this week I posted a picture of a little woodworking project-in-progress to my Instagram. I'd surprised myself with progress yet again. After a lot of sanding and some distractions, I was finally ready to cut my shelves to size.

This is my M.O. with pretty much any project, writing included. I tend to be very head-down when I'm in the thick of it. Whatever phase I'm in feels like all that has been or will ever be. Then one day, bam! I round a corner and find myself at a milestone.

Hands-on projects like my bookshelves support my writing in a lot of ways. I turn to them when I need to decompress or let my brain work through a problem in the background. It helps to keep my body busy. These projects also remind me how even if every day feels the same, even if I feel like I've plateaued, eventually I will turn around and find I've accomplished more than I thought.

I'm currently in an unglamorous place with all my writing projects. Soon I will launch into preorders and other promotion for She's Not Home, which comes out next April, but for now my work on on it is all behind the scenes. I have three new projects in the works, but all are still in the drafting stages. I think a lot of people, when they picture a writer at work, picture us writing new words ‚Äî the first draft. If only the magic happened here in real life! Drafting feels, for me, kind of like sanding those boards for my shelves: hours of showing up, putting in the time, and keeping faith in the potential of this thing in front of me.

All the while, that potential remains invisible to the untrained eye. Or any eye, really.

Invisible though it may be, the magic *is* happening. After setting everything aside to finish She's Not Home earlier this year, it feels great to dig into new projects, write fresh words, and open the door to new ideas. Even though starting over is hard.

Speaking of She's Not Home, next week I'm off to visit a few bookstores and setting locations in the place that inspired the fictional town of Red Hill in the book. The story begins in mid-late October and I'm hoping to hit the temperamental Pennsylvania fall atmosphere that infuses She's Not Home's opening act.

I'll have to save some of the photos and stories I gather next week for after the launch (because spoilers), but I'd also love to share some tidbits with you right away. Most of you haven't read the book yet, so I'll ask: is there anything you want to see or know about the setting, how I built it, why I chose it, and what it means to the story? I'm taking requests! Like I said, I can't give away big plot stuff, but I can talk as much as I want about the writing process and the choices I made while creating my story world.

One big choice was to fictionalize the town! Red Hill is based on the small town where I grew up, but I took some liberties and changed the name.

Anyway, please ask away! I will do my best to answer what I can in the next edition of this letter.
