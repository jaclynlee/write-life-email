Hey [FIRST_NAME/friend]!

I'm currently drafting a memoir about time, friendship, and love (and ADHD, which flavors all of the above). Process-wise, it's a fascinating meld of fiction and non-fiction writing. Today I have a little editing show-and-tell about voice.

The story begins in my elementary school years. When I submitted the first few (rough) chapters to my writing group, they told me the voice sounded too old. It's lovely prose, they insisted, but no third-grader is this self-aware.

They weren't wrong. However, I want to teach people something with this story! I hope to provide validation for people who've had similar experiences and new insights for people who love us.

I started this draft thinking I had to do all that teaching from Page One. Here's a paragraph from the book's opening. Our narrator is (supposedly) in fifth grade, riding the bus to school:

(Also, keep in mind these are all very green drafts!)

*******
The weight of the coats on my back pressed my body against the brown vinyl seat. Applied with different intentions, that heaviness might've been soothing. Like a hug, but alone. Instead the weight was a message. An opportunity. A test. Head hidden inside my hood, face turned into the corner away from the aisle, I pretended my inability to see anyone else meant they could not see me.
*******

The voice is fine, but it doesn't put us in a kid's head. It puts us in an adult's head as they reflect on a childhood experience.

This creates distance between reader and character and can hurt the story. My critique group was right to call it out. Nowadays, readers expect a memoir to read like a novel. The best novels (in my humble opinion) make ample use of a close point of view: one strictly limited to our narrator's maturity, personality, and knowledge.

Novels open with a lot of mystery. Characters start out ignorant. That's the point! By the end of the book, they've learned from and been changed by the story.

And so have we.

Likewise with this memoir. I can start with a young voice. Readers will benefit from experiencing events through her eyes. They'll feel her confusion when things go wrong, even when her mistakes make her look like a jerk. They'll see familiar experiences in a completely new way.

Which is exactly what I want! This is the magic of storytelling.

Anyway, I revised that paragraph:

******
The weight of the coats on my back pressed my body against the seat. I traced the veins in the brown fake-leather with my fingernail. Being buried didn't actually bother me. It felt kind of good. The reason for the weight was the problem. When Danielle had put the first coat on me I hadn't done anything. That would've been the time to do something. Now, with a whole pile of coats on me, I felt frozen.

At least my head was hidden in my hood. I could almost pretend not being able to see anyone meant they couldn't see me.
******

I'll probably revise it many more times. I may even cut it from the final book. Who knows at this point! But it's been a fascinating exercise, getting to know my past self as a character. I have to suspend a lot of my current awareness -- often the very awareness I want to give others with this story -- to give this character the power she needs to pull readers in.

What do you think? How old do the first and second versions of this paragraph feel to you? What burning questions do you now have about the writing process? Hit reply and let me know, and maybe I'll answer in the next newsletter!

xoxo,

Jaclyn
