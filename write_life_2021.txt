Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #78 | july 29, 2022
========================================================

The past couple weeks have been a flurry of activity for me. My perception of time has existed at the extremes -- I am at a standstill as the days whip past in a blur. I recently managed to combine the time-management challenges of having a short-term work crunch, preparing for off-the-grid travel, and my kiddo having only a half-day camp into the span of a single week. Some days I've hoped to do no more than get a grip on what I've missed or dropped or pushed off until the next day.

It's wild to imagine how much the vibe will change in a couple weeks. Right now I've been in the thick of last-minute publishing stuff on She's Not Home, but advanced copies will have gone to print by the time you get this email. Pretty soon I'll have promotional work to do, but the book itself will be a done deal. I don't even know how much time and mental energy this will return to my days.

Around that same time, I'll head off to Maine for an end-of-summer writing retreat. The focus of this retreat will probably be the first draft of my new book. In other words, I'm jumping from late-late-stage book work all the way back to Page One. What a ride!

In the meantime, the next installment of this email will be a special one. It will contain the ‚ú® cover reveal ‚ú® for She's Not Home and the very first üéü ARC raffle üéü! As a thanks for you all indulging my bi-weekly reflections, I'm giving you the very first peek at the cover and very first dibs on advance copies of the book. So -- stay tuned for details, spread the word to your friends, all that jazz.

Now if you'll indulge me once more, I want to hear from you for a new segment in this letter. I'd love to do a Q&A where you all ask me about publishing, writing, favorite books -- whatever's on your mind. So please ask away! And because I personally feel super awkward replying to someone's newsletter email, I created a simple and anonymous Q&A submission form here: https://forms.gle/GkKbsrZ7K3Kqzyqd9

xoxo,

Jaclyn
