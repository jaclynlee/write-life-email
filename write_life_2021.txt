Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #69 | march 1, 2022
========================================================

In January, I spent almost fifty hours revising a ninety-six-thousand-word manuscript. I’ve been back at it over the past couple weeks, incorporating developmental feedback from my publishing team.

January’s work was solitary and self-directed. I retreated into my editing cave and followed my instincts. I didn’t share or discuss the in-progress draft with anyone.

This contrasts sharply with my current assignment, which is very prescriptive. My developmental feedback letter outlines specific suggestions for scenes to add and cut. I have to rename (another) character. It’s essentially a writing to-do list.

You might think this would feel stifling, or like I’d lost ownership of the story. I actually feel more relieved than anything. The path ahead is clear, and will remain so until the book goes to print. People with a better perspective on it than I have think the book is good, and have made a list of alterations to take it across the finish line.

I appreciate this at a time when I can no longer zoom out. I’ve looked at this manuscript for so long, I will never have a fresh take or know how it feels to experience it as a new reader. Have you ever stared at a common word for so long it began to look unfamiliar? In many ways, that’s how I feel about this story.

I think it’s good to recognize when you no longer hold the keys. When it’s time to step aside. Yes, this book is my creative work. It’s also a product. The publisher would like it to sell. I would also like it to sell, for the obvious reasons but also because good book sales mean my words have connected with people. My characters have touched readers’ hearts.

These characters are real people to me. I care about them and I want other people to care about them, too.

Fine-tuning a story can take a lot of work. It’s hard to know when it’s done. I can feel it easily when I read others’ work, when the story has come into itself and reached its mature strength. My own work is trickier. Attachments to scenes and characters and silly details blur a writer’s objectivity.

That makes this near-last revision really exciting. I no longer have to determine when the story is done or if it is good. The hardest work is already behind me. I just have to make it through my list, resubmit the manuscript, rinse and repeat.

Then it’ll be on to the next project. Back into the vast, open-ended world of first drafts.

In the meantime, I’m going to savor these weeks of certainty, of finessing the details, of knowing this story is going to make it out of the drawer.

And I can't wait to share it with you when it does.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
