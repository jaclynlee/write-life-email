Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #67 | november 30, 2021
========================================================

Last week I broke a major rule in my writing life. I shared a young draft not only outside my writing group, but with family.

An author's family should cheerlead and celebrate successes, not provide feedback on works in progress.

Especially if you're writing a memoir.

Nevertheless, when my eight-year-old asked about my current project I couldn't resist sharing the first three chapters. These chapters show me as a sensitive third-grader struggling to fit in at school. They explore a child's escape into rich fantasy worlds and examine how we can unintentionally become both bully and bullied.

Relevant for my own sensitive third-grader who returned to in-person school this fall.

The prose captured his imagination just as it did the adults in my writing group, though for different reasons.
"Did you really collect all that stuff?" he asked, eyes wide. Did I really have a lean-to fort in the woods with a hawk feather, an arrow, and a box turtle shell?

"Yes," I told him. "It's all true stories."

Later, we talked about a scene where I blurted out a mean comment to a classmate struggling with a lesson. He told me how sad he felt for a tablemate when the rest of their table excluded and condescended to him.

"I try to help him," he said. With assignments, but also with the girls at their table. He leveraged his own social capital with them and the teacher to sabotage unkindnesses.

As I tucked him into bed that night he said he felt proud of his actions with this other student. I told him I was glad, because he should.

I also may never have heard this story from him without inviting him into my own.

"Until you said your name," he told me of those chapters, "I thought it was fiction. It just reads so much like -- like a story, you know?"

I did know. Memoir should read this way. Otherwise, in my son's words, "it would just be an autobiography."

When we craft a piece of our life experience into an engaging story, we invite others to examine their own lives. We increase understanding and empathy. We shine a light into shadowy corners. I have a mission for this book, but you won't find it explicitly on the page. It'll slip into the reader's imagination alongside the story.

I may live to regret sharing my adult writing with my child. He's a voracious reader and has asked me almost daily when he can see more. It's probably naive to hope he'll lose interest before we reach any age-inappropriate content. But I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

For now, I'll take his reaction as an indicator of success. My opening chapters started some worthwhile conversations and, at a more basic level, my third-grade protagonist has passed the ultimate authenticity test ;)

xoxo,

Jaclyn
