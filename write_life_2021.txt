Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #72 | april 20, 2022
========================================================

Hanging around writers as much as I have, I've grown to appreciate how unique we all are. I consider a great writer someone who writes great books. However, I doubt any writer is great at every part of the writing process. That's what revisions are for -- and why revisions look different for all of us.

For example, my critique partners tell me I can write great-sounding prose about anything. I may play with a passage to bring it in tune with how it felt in my head, but I also may not. My first drafts usually sound pretty good out of the gate.

By contrast, other writers have an innate feel for stakes and tension. Their first drafts are already exciting stories. My critique feedback for them is often to slow down. Let us linger in the moment. Give us a peek at the character's internal emotional reactions. What are they thinking?

My first drafts garner the feedback, "This was beautiful to read, and you've created a rich emotional atmosphere, but I have no idea why I'm reading it."

Whoops. Thank goodness for revisions!

I actually like revising far more than drafting. My recent round of novel revisions has been particularly satisfying. I had the benefit of some excellent developmental editing feedback, which I think allowed my particular strengths as a writer to shine.

I'm good at the solitary part of writing: the rendering of a particular moment on the page. How a random detail can feel poignant to a character who notices it at the right time. Developmental edits amplify the story's power by shifting these moments and details, or by cutting one here and adding another there. My writing style allows me to make changes like this relatively efficiently -- a good thing, because the actual story is always an iterative process.

I started this email talking about writers, but we all have parts of a process where we shine, and parts where we benefit from others' input. The key, for me, is knowing which parts are which -- where I have the most to learn, and where I need to trust my instincts.

This, more than possessing any specific strength, is what I think helps us build something great.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
