Hey [FIRST_NAME/friend]!

One thing no one tells you about being an author? You don't write all day.

I'm my own marketing, finance, and human resources department. I'm the smiling face at the front desk and the visionary CEO.

Such is life as a one-person shop.

I also serve as our household's default parent. This is both a tricky juggle and a huge privilege. My husband has the burden and luxury of a job from which he can be fired for not working enough. By contrast, my long-term success (and income) are roughly proportional to my ability to carve out time and prioritize my work.

This became tough going during our one-and-a-half virtual school years.

Life has returned to a more manageable state (for everyone) this fall. I now appreciate (more) the privilege my flexibility confers. It's nice to have one parent in a household able to interrupt work as needed with no risk of getting fired.

A double-edged sword, for sure.

In our writing group, we often read the same story many times over. On the first read we might offer general impressions on plot and pacing. Does the opening draw us in? Do we care about the main character? Do we immediately begin to grasp what's at stake here?

In future critiques, we'll dig into details. We write nit-picky notes in the margins about language. We ask questions like, "Is it believable this thought would cross the narrator's mind in this moment? Maybe that sort of reflection would feel more natural later, as she's staring out the window of the train." We note places where we wished for a single extra beat of pause here. A glimpse of our narrator's inner world there.

As the author solves the big issues through revisions and rewrites, the smaller ones become visible.

I recently found myself lamenting my lack of time to engage in leisure activities. My impatience with my slow progress on lingering pandemic clutter and messes around the house. How I committed us to redoing our basement before Christmas, and that feels like a huge undertaking.

But as I vented about these things to my husband the other day, I realized something very, very important: I'm not complaining about lack of writing time.

I'm working on two books right now. I have a third one planned as soon as I wrap my current draft.
I'm spending thirty hours a week in the office.

Some of that time is spent on household and family stuff, yes. But still.

Things are happening. Slowly, but they're happening.

I guess what I'm saying is, lately I've resumed complaining about normal struggles. Doing the equivalent of shifting paragraphs around, polishing language, and adding missing emotional exposition in a story that's otherwise working.

It's a relief to reach this point when writing a story. Turns out it's a relief when you're living the story, too.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
