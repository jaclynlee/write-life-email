Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #73 | may 10, 2022
========================================================

The other night when I was tucking my kid into bed, he asked me, "Have you written any more of that story you let me read part of?"

(Like many children, he loves to start interesting conversations at lights-out time üòÇ)

"No," I told him. "I couldn't quite figure out how to make the story work."

He responded with an astute observation that the project is a memoir. If it's a true story, can't I just write what happened, how it happened, and call it a day?

Not really. Storytelling is a complicated process. It requires not just putting words on a page, but taking thoughtful pauses and doing a lot of pruning.

My other non-fiction work-in-progress tells the story of a ruined motel by the ocean. Also, the story of its late owner and more broadly, how greed and insular alliances have shaped the town she and her motel lived and died in. I'm relying heavily on my story-telling brain, doing what feels like the research equivalent of discovery writing. The piece I end up writing may be as long as a feature-length article. A roomy container, but only enough to scratch the surface of the "whole" story and its characters.

Narrative writing takes time --- and not just time at the keyboard. A memoir, I explained to my kiddo, still has to be a compelling story. I have to decide which pieces to include, where to include them, and *how* to include them. Like in fiction, I need to bring every chapter in tune with the larger story.

My mind usually works these things out while I'm doing something else, like taking a long walk or digging in the garden. Last week I went on a research trip for the motel story. I expected it to feel revelatory and propulsive. If anything, it reminded me to slow down and process. There are so many stories to tell. I need to hone in on just one.

(Here's a picture from that trip: https://newsletters.jaclynpaul.com/writelife_assets/2022/073/beach_gate.JPG)

"You have to write more," my son said of the memoir. Perhaps he feared it had been replaced by my obsession with the motel. "I really want to read it."

"I will," I told him, and I meant it. But then I told him about the novel I just finished editing. I first drafted it in 2009, but I put it away for a long time. It was a good story, but I wasn't a good enough writer to tell it. Or maybe I just hadn't lived enough. Maybe both. I told my son this, too.

The best stories don't require a specific moment for relevance. They require deep attention to craft.

Yes, I will write more on these stories and others. But I also need some time to process. Fortunately, it's spring gardening season. What my nine-year-old doesn't understand yet, but I hope he will in time, is we don't need to figure everything out immediately. We don't need to know how the pieces fit together the moment we discover them. Sometimes it takes time to find the right thread for the story we want to tell --- even if it's a true story, and even if we're writing things as they happened.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
