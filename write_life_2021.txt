Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #71 | april 5, 2022
========================================================

As I progress through these busy last stages of novel polishing, I've learned a few important lessons.

First, I still have no idea how long anything takes, or will take, to do. I had no idea when I redid my basement in December, no idea when I did a major rewrite of this novel in January, and no idea when I incorporated the developmental editing feedback in another round of revisions in March.

Sometime around mid-March, I got the familiar sinking feeling that happens after too many days of every step taking five times longer than I expect. This time the feeling never went away because the phenomenon never went away. Every day I sat down to work on those revisions, I felt at once intensely productive and like I'd gotten almost nowhere. I was working well and making excellent progress, but I'd vastly underestimated the total amount of progress necessary to reach the goal.

Which brings me to my second lesson: I can write a lot even when it isn't easy. Sometimes I give myself space when a project feels tricky. This helps me process ideas and possible solutions and avoid burnout. However, I had no time for such things last month. Some days I spent between five and seven hours writing. This is a lot for me. My ideal is a solid one to three hours of actual deep writing time.

I had one fun scene and a couple hopeful ones, but a lot of this writing was challenging and dark. Fights, emotional breakdowns, bad news, and heartbreak. Still, I soldiered on. This pace of work isn't sustainable, and I'm intentionally spending the days between my deadline Friday and an editorial feedback meeting tomorrow *not writing*. Yet I was impressed with the momentum I generated and the tough spots I was able to write through. I want to carry the good parts of this into my next project.

And that's the third lesson, I think. As much as I love routine and predictability, every project is different. Work happens in phases. Sometimes I benefit from disappearing into my writing cave and working in a way that is not sustainable long term, but that's okay because I never intend it to be long term. Books -- and their publication schedules -- have a beginning and an end.

Last week I did a lot of writing and very little email or cooking. I did not play video games, nor did I follow up on any potential leads for a new writing project.

For the first half of this week, I will do no significant writing. I'm cleaning out my email inbox, scheduling a painter to come give me an estimate for the fence I haven't gotten time to paint myself, and inching a few other work projects forward.

Phases are okay, as long as we remain aware of them and use them intentionally. At least that's what I'm telling myself today ;)

Until the next phase...

xoxo,

Jaclyn
