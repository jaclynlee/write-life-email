Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)

========================================================

In yesterday's blog post about pen names (https://www.jaclynpaul.com/im-already-a-successful-author-and-thats-why-i-need-a-pen-name/), I promised to use this newsletter to share a little more about where mine came from.

Starting this fall, I will publish fiction under the name Lena George. I explain a little more about the reasons for this open pen name in my blog post. The short version is, I (and my publisher) want to keep my fiction and non-fiction catalogs separate for business reasons.

So why Lena?

Choosing a new name for myself was a trickier than I expected! I went through several iterations before I arrived at Lena George.

At first I thought this might be a fun opportunity to take on a more gender-neutral pseudonym, like Aspen or Sidney. I briefly held onto Sidney as a frontrunner because of a family history connection to the town of Sidney, New York. I love Aspen but it felt a little pretentious and didn't pair well with my first choice for a last name. Also, I ended up scrapping the idea of a gender-neutral first name. I write a lot of literary/book club fiction centered around complex female characters. Ideally, my personal brand should reflect that.

I then considered adopting a family name, but none of the first names I could think of would fit. Eventually I settled on Lena. It's a somewhat common German name, which gives a nod to my heritage, but otherwise has no hidden meaning. It just has a nice ring to it.

For a last name I initially chose Williamson, after an ancestor of mine who worked for the railroads before taking over a well-known tavern at the site of what is now the University of Maryland's School of Social Work. I love taverns and railroads, and the Baltimore connection was really cool.

However, I ran into two problems: one, someone noted the shared last name with author and onetime presidential candidate Marianne Williamson. Given the choice, did I want to risk creating a mental association between myself and a controversial public figure? Maybe not. But more important to me, an Amazon search turned up another author named Lena Williamson. Our audiences looked unlikely to overlap, but I didn't want to create any discoverability problems for either of us — especially since I had control over my chosen name.

So I bid a somewhat sad farewell to Williamson and came to my next and final contender: Lena George.

The name had the right sound and feel, but it also maintained a family connection. I recently learned my great-grandfather (first name) George not only shared my birthday, but was our family's only other known novelist. His untimely death in 1941 made him somewhat of a mysterious figure, more defined by his absence than the details of his long-ago presence. In taking on his first name as my fictional last name, I finally found a way to connect my author persona to my roots.

Through all of this, I gained new respect for my friends who have changed their names in adulthood! Even in this context, choosing a new name for myself felt like a weighty decision. Just two words, but they had to say the right thing and feel like they fit. Most of us don't choose our names and make do with what we have. Having the choice in my hands, I felt a little more pressure for it to seem right.

Now let's just hope Lena doesn't get herself into trouble and need to change her name! ;)

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Follow Lena on Instagram **

I will maintain a single website and Facebook page, but I did give Lena her own Instagram. Follow me there for updates on my fiction writing and life in general. This is a fun opportunity for me to post random stuff outside of my other account (https://www.instagram.com/jaclynpaulwriter/), which is very focused.
