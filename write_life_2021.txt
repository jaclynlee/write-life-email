Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)

When I decided to try the #1000wordsofsummer (https://1000wordsofsummer.substack.com/about) challenge a few weeks ago, I was curious if I'd actually do it. I felt pretty committed to doing the writing -- 1000 words per day for the first two weeks of June -- provided the story and I were ready. After all, I can write a lot of words when I need to. I just sometimes need a kick in the pants.

As it turns out, we weren't ready, and I didn't start that new draft, and I think that was exactly the right choice.

My last writing challenge was National Novel Writing Month in 2009. Back then, I could afford to dedicate the month of November to writing 50,000 words in my free time. Any words. And I did. I got fewer drinks with friends after work and played a little less World of Warcraft, and with only a few hours left in November I hit my target.

The resulting book was not very good. However, that mattered less in the long run than crossing the finish line. I had never completed a full book draft before. The community and public declaration of NaNoWriMo got me over the hump and proved I could do it.

Over a decade later, my calculus has changed. I still love the idea of word count challenges, and I still occasionally set word count goals for myself, but word count means less than it used to.

Nowadays I care more about the quality of that first draft. I know I can get the words out, and I know they'll read pretty well even on the first pass. That doesn't mean they'll make a good story.

I also feel more precious about my writing time than ever. I'm older, I have a kid, I have obligations to communities beyond the online gaming world. My tax return brands me an official Writer. The much-celebrated sh*tty first draft no longer feels like the accomplishment it once did. It feels more like sending perfectly good work through the shredder.

Don't get me wrong. Plenty of well-crafted prose ends up on the cutting room floor no matter what. But I have the skills and experience to do better than I did in 2009. To spend far less time trashing hours of work (and tens of thousands of words) to fix a weak story.

I don't write from a super-detailed plan or outline, but as I've gotten older (as a human and a writer) I've learned the benefit of pausing before I jump into a new draft. Thinking through the story's crucial beats. Identifying up front what's at stake for the main character and why anyone should care. Writing takes time, revising takes time, and everything else in my life takes time. I don't want to waste any of it. Not when I know better.

I learned many years ago to avoid phrases like "I always" and "I would never." People grow and change and evolve, and so do our creative practices. There's a reason community-focused word count challenges attract a lot of green writers. At that stage it's a great tool. It helped me clear that first-first-draft hurdle.

Honestly, I'd still find these challenges fun and productive if they happened to line up with a week (or month) of heavy drafting. But nowadays I'm much more sure of my process, and much less inclined to write a bunch of words just to prove I can.

Which is all to say, just because something sounds fun and helps a lot of other people meet their goals, doesn't mean it's right for you. Sometimes the best choice is counterintuitive, and we need to sit the fun thing out.

Or at least that fun thing. I've been having a lot of fun getting to know these characters, and once I get their whole story on the page, I think you will, too.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
