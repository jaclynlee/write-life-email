Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #66 | november 18, 2021
========================================================

Observant readers of this email might notice today is Thursday, not Tuesday. I was away earlier this week, helping my dad with a painting project at the family beach bungalow.

On Tuesday we took some time for a five-and-a-half-mile hike along the beach. It was a perfect fall day, sunny and cool, not too breezy, ocean placid and shimmering on one side, barrier-island wilderness on the other. When we finally set foot on concrete again, our legs felt wobbly as they readjusted to the idea of steady ground.

For a whole stack of reasons unrelated to what I want to say today, this day felt like a such a gift.

I also wrote very little about it in my journal. Just a rough sketch to jog my memory. Sometimes this happens. I used to worry I wasn't capturing enough, remembering enough. But we see the world differently through the lens of our art. Sometimes we need to shut all that off and exist in the real world.

Usually I work ahead before a trip like this. I write my content and schedule it to publish while I'm away. Last week I wrote two versions of this newsletter, both of which I later threw out. I then told myself I'd write something new on Monday.

I thought surely I'd have some commentary to share about the beach in November. And maybe I will, later.

But we don't always have something to say. Or what we thought we had to say doesn't end up feeling relevant in the moment.

And that's okay.

After I finish drafting the book I'm writing now, my next project is a quiet drama about family, about an old house at the beach and the deep and impractical bond we can have with a place like this. There you will find shadows of this trip and others. The biting wind, the fall colors in the dune grasses, the wallpaper bubbling and peeling under a second coat of paint.

But this week, for me, simply being there -- being around -- was enough.

I hope you find some time to just be with your people in the coming weeks, too.
