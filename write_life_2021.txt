Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #70 | march 17, 2022
========================================================

I recently offered to do a little volunteer project for a friend. It's time-consuming and does not engage the linguistic part of my brain. This makes it an excellent fidget. Working on this project during a recent Zoom meeting, I interrupted less and listened better -- a fidget win!

Afterward I thought, too bad I don't have more meetings coming up.

Which is weird, I know. If sharing an office with my husband has taught me anything, it's to appreciate my high-quality, low-quantity meeting schedule.

I used to work with a bigger organization and team -- meaning I had more meetings. While I did sometimes struggle to fit my "real" work in around them, I also think I valued them more than the average person. I secretly enjoy working with people, at least in concept.

I also have a tendency to let my work life become my social life. Making plans felt cumbersome even before the pandemic, and work could leave me feeling peopled out. We had a very close-knit and social office. Many of us became friends outside of work. I also find working quietly alongside someone I like quite socially fulfilling.

Work became the new college dormitory for me: a group of default friends I could hang out with almost every day with zero logistical overhead.

When I started my work-from-home indie lifestyle almost ten years ago, my neighbors filled some of this void. Even more so during the pandemic when we were all home. I never missed going to work for someone else.

And yet I've been a little weird lately. Off my game. Fighting a persistent feeling of languishing despite having plenty of fulfilling work.

And now this wish for more meetings, ostensibly so I can spend them doing what amounts to busy work?

I have several hypotheses on why I've felt off-kilter lately. All of them relate to transitions, which are a particular struggle for me.

But also, maybe I need social time. As much as I love winter, it can be a little isolating, especially if you rely on random encounters with neighbors as a social outlet.

Also, if you spend it writing a book.

It's easy to forget, even if I get peopled out easily, even if I often prefer to read (or write) a book and struggle to get my head around making plans, I do enjoy quality time with friends.

This weekend I've promised myself to attend my book club's monthly meeting. Yes, this means I need to formulate a reaction to the book (even if I haven't finished it, which is fine). I need to choose a potluck dish to bring. I also need to wrangle all the logistical details to get myself to a specific place at a specific time. Perhaps I'll plan to walk with a friend. Arriving with someone makes it less intimidating to enter the room.

Once I'm there and I've sat myself down with a drink and some snacks, I will have fun. I will delight in hearing others' tales of recent adventures. I will snoop on the host's bookshelves and eat a bunch of delicious food I did not have to cook and find out if the person who always has the opposite take from me enjoyed this book as much as I did not.

When I had a full-time "real job," and later when my kiddo was very small, more writing time almost always cured this languishing feeling. I needed to carve out a few hours or days, usually alone, to do my thing.

But my life has changed shape over the years. So much so, I might actually need to make an effort to step away from my desk a little more often.

What an odd concept that is. I'll let you know how it turns out.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
