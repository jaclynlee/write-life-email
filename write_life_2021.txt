Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #75 | june 7, 2022
========================================================

As I wrap up the final bits of polish on this novel manuscript, I’ve shifted my focus to more mundane, administrative publishing chores. Parking social media handles. Paying licensing fees. Making a list of people I need to ask for blurbs. This should feel more boring, and certainly less emotionally fraught, than the intense developmental editing process I’ve just endured...right?

Yes. It should. But I’ve always had a funny relationship with the word "should."

Earlier today I called a record label on the phone to follow up on a licensing request. Fun fact, as a novelist you cannot include lyrics in your work without explicit permission from their publisher. I really dislike using the phone, but the guy who picked up was super chill and friendly and helpful, which put me at ease for our conversation.

Per his advice, I re-sent my original request and copied him on the new email -- at which point I spiraled into completely unproductive anxiety. What if, based on the few paragraphs I’d sent him from the middle of my book, he concluded it was the worst piece of fiction he’d ever read in his life and wished he could reply to my email telling me I had no right to waste three minutes and fifty-nine seconds of his time calling him on the phone about this piece of trash, which by the way no artist on their label would ever associate themselves with, not for the highest licensing fee I could imagine, so I could consider the matter closed.

When forwarding the original copy of my request, I made sure to add a note that this was an unedited version. You know, in case anyone found the prose completely unreadable but thought there could be a good story hiding somewhere underneath.

Oh and what if the artist ends up reading the book and thinks it’s completely pathetic?

Maybe I should rethink my entire life, no?

Fortunately I’ve been to this particular rodeo before and I know all the feelings that come before a book launch. Everything will most likely be fine and this is all normal, blah blah blah.

But still. I expected to feel less vulnerable about publishing fiction under a pen name than I do writing about personal experiences under my real name.

It really should feel easier, I think. Should!

But it doesn’t, in part because I suspect I care more about people liking my fictional characters than I do about them liking me. I swear it makes perfect sense in my head.

Anyway, I promise I really do love this book and its characters and I can’t wait for you to meet them because I think you will love them too. And if you’ve ever felt terror and self-doubt before putting yourself out there and risking rejection and criticism...grab a drink with a writer you know. Most of us will totally understand ;)

xoxo,

Jaclyn
