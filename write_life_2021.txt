Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #74 | may 24, 2022
========================================================

If you've read my book Order from Chaos (https://adhdhomestead.net/orderfromchaos/) or one of my multiple blog posts on the subject (a few examples: https://adhdhomestead.net/small-wins-clear-task-logjams/, https://adhdhomestead.net/habit-hearts/, https://adhdhomestead.net/try-smaller/), you may already know I swear by small goals. Like, really small goals.

When editing a manuscript, I will set a goal of opening the document once a day. If I'm drafting, I might commit to fifty or one hundred words per day. For do-gooder habits like maintaining a daily yoga practice, I will set a goal to do one yoga pose. If I forget until bedtime and spend ten intentional seconds in a forward fold before climbing under the covers, I call it a win.

Small goals aren't about underachieving, though. They're about inviting. Maybe I don't feel like I have any words in me one day, but once I force out my allotted fifty, I catch some momentum and keep going. Or maybe I don't, and that's fine because interacting with the work at all means something too.

Last week I took a rare detour from my small-goals lifestyle and decided to do #1000wordsofsummer (https://1000wordsofsummer.substack.com/about). From June 4-17, I will (ostensibly) write one thousand words per day on a new project.

To be clear, there are many days on which I write more than a thousand words. Yesterday was one of them, in fact. Today may be, too. I just avoid committing to it as a goal because as a goal-oriented person, I won't sit down to write at all if don't feel I can hit my target. Lower targets usually beget more consistent work and more words written.

I last joined a writing challenge in 2009, when I did National Novel Writing Month. I don't remember if I felt ready, but I wrote fifty thousand words in thirty days regardless.

I don't know if I feel ready to write several thousand words on this new book, either. What I do know is I can find many, many reasons not to feel ready for a big commitment.

Maybe I'll write a thousand words every day and maybe I won't. I'm trying not to get hung up on it, even though my brain loves to latch onto rules and goals. My true goal here, the reason I decided to break my own rules and join a writing challenge, is to jumpstart a first draft.

First drafts, for me, are usually trash and never the most fun part of the job. The magic happens in revisions. However, I already love the story and the characters for this new book. They deserve a trash first draft because they deserve an opportunity to shine in those revisions.

Plus, what's the worst that could happen? Sometimes we goal-oriented people need that reminder, too. Even if I don't hit the magic number, each extra word inches me closer to a finished draft.

Which brings me back to my original point: all progress is progress, no matter how small. Let's give it all its due.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
