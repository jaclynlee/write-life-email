Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)

========================================================

The other day an acquaintance asked me a question I get often, and I think is worth answering here: "What is the most advantageous way for me to buy a copy of your book?"

In this case they meant Order from Chaos, but my answer would be the same for She's Not Home. Even more adamant, perhaps. An author's personal connections often wonder how to best support them. Should we purchase through Amazon, to show the algorithm there is demand for this book? Or should we pay the author for a copy from their personal stash, so they get the most money from the sale? I'll break down my feelings on this issue below.

First of all, I prefer to think of a single book sale as an opportunity. Authors don't make much money from one sale. I like to give my one sale an opportunity to keep working for the author -- and the literary ecosystem they depend on -- long after I pay for a book and take it home.

For personal contacts, I always recommend the local bookstore first. There is no benefit, and actually some possible disadvantage, to friends/family/neighbors/stalkers buying a bunch of copies from Amazon. When you buy an author's book from an independent bookseller, you support both your local small-business economy and the community of tastemakers who will (hopefully!) put that book in the hands of more readers.

If you don't see an author's book at your local bookshop, you can special order it. This is especially easy now that we have IndieBound. You can search for any book and order it to a bookstore near you, without picking up the phone or approaching anyone in person. But if you're feeling particularly brave, you can say a good word about the book or author when you pick it up from the store!

All that said, I know some people will order books from Amazon. If you do this, you might be helping an author with future sales, but only if you already buy a lot of similar books. Amazon's ranking algorithm is very good at learning which books sell well with their intended audience, and it will reward those books by suggesting them to potential buyers more often. However, if sales data is too all-over-the-place, Amazon won't know who needs to discover this book. This is functionally the same as knowing *no one* needs to discover the book.

I don't want anyone to come away feeling like they can't or shouldn't buy a friend or relative's book because they would be buying from Amazon. If you're an Amazon buyer who wants to support an author but don't usually buy their kind of book, my best recommendation is to wait a little while before you buy. Give sales data time to accumulate and order it a month or two after publication if you can. This will allow the algorithm time to learn how the book fits into its category and who Amazon should be recommending it to.

Once in a blue moon I'll sell books directly -- I'm actually planning a little sale of personalized signed copies of Order from Chaos to liquidate some publisher returns -- but I don't emphasize it. Even if it's my neighbor asking, and I could run inside and grab a book for them, I will always suggest they order it from our local bookstore. I might get more money from a single direct sale, but I'm rarely thinking in terms of a single sale. I'm thinking about how that sale can do the most long-term good. And long-term, nothing beats supporting the indie bookseller ecosystem and establishing a reputation as a strong seller in my category.

Hopefully this sheds some light on a dark corner of the book world! In a future letter I'll cover a favorite related topic: how to support an author without spending any money at all! Even though I love buying my favorite authors' books several times over -- for myself, as gifts, for the library -- these sales are only a small piece of the puzzle.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
