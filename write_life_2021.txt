Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #79 | august 10, 2022
========================================================

I've embarked on a Very Busy Month Indeed. Life would already feel hectic with the flurry of behind-the-scenes book stuff happening right now (more on that later), but I'll also be on the road at least as many days as I'm home in August.

Some of that time on the road is all fun, and some of it has work attached. I just returned from eight days down the shore with my family. This was fun but exhausting. I play pretty hard on vacation. After a week of surfing, playing in the water, walking on the sand, and attending a huge Phish concert on the beach, I was completely wiped. And I did also try to relax! I read two books, replenished my energy with plenty of beer and hard pretzels, and finally got an Atlantic County library card. If you're wondering what a writer with ADHD does to blow off steam after finishing a big work project, this vacation is one example!

This week I'm home to catch up before the next thing: a four-day writing retreat in Maine. Hopefully I'll come back with a solid (re)start on on this next book.

Before I do that, though, I want to leave you with something extra special: the cover for She's Not Home! I'll do a public reveal when I get my paperback advance copies but for now my Write Life readers are the first and only to see this beaut.

What do you think!? Design is so not my thing, and I always love seeing my words and stories translated into a visual product.

This also means ARCs (aka advance reader copies) are here! You can snag one by joining my street team*. The street team helps get the word out about new books by posting reviews and ratings on Goodreads, Amazon, and social media. You don't need a big following or anything like that -- every rating and review counts! Use this link to sign up, and please forward it to any bookish friends you think would like to read or review She's Not Home: https://forms.gle/6J4yhbCKC8bKf8YH9

And because I always forget to re-introduce myself and my projects, here's a little summary of the story for you:

***
In SHE'S NOT HOME, a mother and daughter find that a goodbye may be what reunites them in a poignant story of family ties, shared grief, and the love between mother and child.

Sheryl already lost one daughter by being the fun parent. She's determined to do it right with her other daughter, no matter how much Mariana whines about one chance for a normal night. No misbehavior, no stoner friends, and absolutely no parties. As if missing homecoming amounts to tragedy. Sheryl knows real tragedy--and she's not about to make the same mistake twice.

But all Mariana wants is to escape the shadow of her sister Sheena. She's tired of being seen as the daughter that survived and missing out on experiences she shouldn't have to fight for--like senior homecoming.

So when Mariana discovers the truth about how Sheena died, she runs away. For the first time, Mariana is faced with the reality of making her own choices, while Sheryl is left to contend with losing another daughter.

Told with lyrical prose and unerring honesty, SHE'S NOT HOME is a heartfelt exploration of the power of family to destroy, but also to heal.
***

The book will be in stores this fall. Follow me here and on Instagram/Facebook for more updates, and sign up for the street team if you want to read an early copy next month and help spread the word leading up to pub day.

And -- wish me luck wrapping up this wild summer! I hope your summer ends on a positive note as well.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

* Yes, I know I promised a raffle! While I will be raffling physical books eventually, I wanted to open digital ARCs to anyone who wants to join the street team. So stay tuned!
