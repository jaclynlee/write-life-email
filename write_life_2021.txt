Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)
issue #80 | september 22, 2022
========================================================

I spent last weekend at the beach with my college roommates, reconnecting as a group for the first time since 2019. It was truly lovely. It was also one of those weekends I knew would be packed end-to-end with social time (because that was the point). Honoring my temperament, I added some buffer days on either end to prepare before and decompress after.

I used one of those before-days to do a little work, have a little fun on my own, and do a few chores. I biked to the grocery store. I vacuumed the living room furniture and dusted the baseboards and cleaned the patio and snagged some tasty-looking IPAs from the beverage place. At three points throughout the day, I walked or rode my skateboard to the beach for fruitless-but-instructive surf checks. I took care of a few work things. Then I lounged in the hammock in the side yard and read a book.

As the afternoon sun turned golden, I marveled at all I had been able to fit into a single day -- and it wasn't even over! I'd kept a relaxed pace, mixed in plenty of enjoyable activities, and yet managed to get a lot done. How?

This is a question many of us ask, in one form or another, quite often. How can we find the time to write an entire book? To read for pleasure? And how do some people -- people who appear to have as many or more responsibilities as we do -- make it work when we feel stuck making excuses?

And, relatedly: where is the line between an excuse and an actual limitation?

Time is a strange beast, but that day I got so much done? This was a day I had no obligations to anyone else. I was alone, away from home, out of the office, and I owned every minute of the day.

This is a rare sort of day for most of us. It's unrealistic to expect or even want to live an obligation-free life with a completely empty calendar. And yet, if we can engineer such a day every once in a while, it can teach us an important lesson:

This is how long a day is, when we don't wake up with our time already spoken for.

When I clean out a closet, I like to pull everything out. This is the most efficient way to dust and vacuum the space before putting stuff back in, but it also shows me how much space I have. This is impossible to perceive when the closet is crammed full of junk.

Pulling everything out of the closet also presents me with a choice: what will I put back in? What is worth its cubic inches of volume? I force myself to answer this question for every item. Emptying the closet gives me an opportunity to use the space more intentionally, to only replace items I mean -- and want -- to have in there.

A free day presents us with the same opportunity. Knowing this is how it would feel to have no obligations, knowing these are the same minutes others use to read more or to finish that book draft, what is worth keeping? What is worth the minutes it takes away from other things?

Because it's not really that there's not enough time in the day. It's that many of us allow demands on our time to pile up like junk in the hall closet. We let our days become so full, we lose sight of how much space actually exists in them.

And yes, I know some of us will naturally end up with fuller days (and closets) depending on our desires, our priorities, and our seasons in life. That's good to be aware of, too. But no matter our situation, I think it's healthy to take stock every once in a while. If there's something we're yearning for, what's keeping us from it -- and does it have to be that way?

It's a tricky and sometimes painful question, and one I'll be asking a lot as I embark on these next few book projects.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
