Jaclyn's Write Life
(A bi-weekly journal of one writer's life -- in the real world and the fictional ones.)

========================================================

Friends...

This week marks just two months until She's Not Home hits bookstores üò± [https://www.jaclynpaul.com/shes-not-home-launch-info/]

Am I supposed to pretend I'm not anxious about this? Be all peppy and effortlessly confident?

No, I can't do that. This newsletter is nothing if not an honest space.

I am feeling very anxious about this!

[fun cover/launch date image: https://www.jaclynpaul.com/jaclynpaul_com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Coming-April-25-2023.png]

But it's okay. I'm a very anxious person in general, and also an introverted person, and book launches are inherently vulnerable and extroverted affairs. The book is good, though. My anxiety aside, I know a lot of people are going to meet and love these characters, and I feel honored to share them with the world.

I need your help, though. Readers' actions before a book's publication date can make a huge difference. Do you want to read the book? Preorder it from your local bookstore [https://www.indiebound.org/book/9798986678504] (okay, or Amazon if that's your thing [https://www.amazon.com/Shes-Not-Home-Lena-George/dp/B0B9J21MNP/]). Mark it "want to read" on your Goodreads [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63107212]. Have you already gotten your hands on an advance review copy [https://booksirens.com/book/YY4QU0P/N0ACAXY]? Leave a Goodreads review. Know someone who might enjoy the book? Tell them about it. Bonus points if they are in a book club! See me posting on social media? Share stuff about the book [https://www.facebook.com/JaclynLPaul/posts/pfbid02FYKVEVu3mUP7gZE6BLSvpe4takxwGYBrYyqf5qsEMHVAr56e2WDjQSA1Mwd2LYAnl]. Overachiever? Check out this blog post I made about ways to support your favorite authors [https://www.jaclynpaul.com/how-to-support-authors-you-love/].

And if you live near Baltimore, put April 25 at 6:00 p.m. on your calendar. There are some really great plans in the works for the launch event, and you will not want to miss it. Really looking forward to sharing more details on that soon.

Thank you all for joining me on this wild ride!

xoxo,

Jaclyn
