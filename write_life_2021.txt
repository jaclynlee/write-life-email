Jaclyn's Write Life

Hey [FIRST_NAME/friend]!

I have a confession to make.

I let myself get discouraged about this newsletter.

Without getting into particulars, I lost my way a bit. I let something petty take the wind out of my sails.

Being a writer is funny, though. We quit projects all the time, but we can be bad quitters. We get an itch. The only project I ever officially shelved -- and by officially I mean, publicly announced I would never finish or even open again -- is scheduled to publish a year from now. Projects choose us, even when we ask them not to.

But if we want to see a project through to maturity, there comes a time we need to choose it, not the other way around. Like any long-term relationship, every writing project feels great at the beginning. Great enough to fool us into believing this time, we won't hit rough patches. We won't have days when we truly need to choose to stay the course, even though doing so feels like no fun at all.

Now that's really funny.

I took a little trip to the beach last weekend. It was a lovely reset: almost four days alone to think, read, write, spend time in the ocean, and (lest anyone get too jealous) do chores at a different house. After a whirlwind August and September, I needed it. My brain felt so scrambled.

One night as I was walking to dinner I thought to myself, "Writing a book takes a lot of time."

As in, writing this book will, similar to those before it, take a lot of time. Obviously.

Laying down the first draft is my least-favorite part of the process. That's where I am now. It probably accounts for fewer hours than the revising and editing phases, but it feels longer.

The drafting phase also feels the riskiest. Once I have a complete manuscript, a rough landscape of the story, I breathe a sigh of relief. A book isn't a done deal at that point, but it has reached the age of viability. Its chances of surviving -- and thriving -- will only increase from there on out. Until then, I secretly fear I will abandon the draft.

Fortunately, I've told several people about this project. I have almost thirty thousand words written on the first draft. Trashing it already feels like a Big Deal. More so than soldiering on through the morass of uncertainty and imposter syndrome to just finish the damn draft.

Same with this newsletter. In my younger years I abandoned my share of blogs, zines, and social media handles. At some point I vowed to make this current set my last. That means owning my lapses and continuing to develop this space. Refining, not restarting.

In other words, I'm still here. Still writing. And in the coming weeks I look forward to sharing some of that new writing with you. Because I appreciate that you're still here, too.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
